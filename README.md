# Restrap - React-Bootstrap Component Library

This project was bootstraped with the `create-react-app` and is a work in progress (WIP)

## Why was this project created?
---
The initial reason for this library was a way for me to really learn React and how to create reusable components that could be used on my own sites or in a client's project. Since my early days of HTML, like most developers at that time, I had my own opinions of how tags should have been designed and implemented, but that was not in my/our control, until now. 

Today, React and other frameworks like Angular, Polymer and many others are redefining how tags work and custom components have become common place. An organization can now have it's own brand of 'HTML Components' based on it's business requirements or development workflow. They also can include any leading edge or current framework stylings like Bootstrap and Foundation or whatever is next. 

As I work on this project, I hope this library could become something usable for the developer community. I will try to keep the files in a logical order and add attributes that make logical sense over convenience.  


First, I need to finish my initial effort and build some simple sample sites with the components to work out any kinks. For now, I will continue to work on this until I reach a stopping point or reach my goal. This effort is just a solo project and I may not invite other unless something happens to change that. For now, if you clone this repository, you can get started with it like so: 

### Clone Repository: 
---
```git
git clone https://github.com/claytonbarnette/restrap [your-project-name]
```


### Install Dependencies:

After the downloading the repo, ```cd``` into the [your-project-name] folder, then issue the following commands. 

> **Note:** *You will need Nodejs and NPM installed to run these commands.*

``` javascript 
npm install
npm start
```
The ``create-react-app`` development server should start, displaying the index page of the project at http://localhost:3000. If you get specific errors related to the ``create-react-app``, see documentation on the [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) website.

---

> **Note:**  
*I may add a documentation pages for each component later, but for now, the comments within each component file will provide enough guidence. These files are located in the [``src/lib``](https://github.com/claytonbarnette/restrap/tree/master/src "Source Lib Directory").* If something doesn't make sense, start an issue so I can look at it to see if I can help make things clearer.  Some things I did notice myself and I have a list of simple issues that may come up. 


~ Enjoy
