# Restrap - React-Bootstrap Component Library

This project was bootstraped with the `create-react-app` and is a work in progress (WIP)

The initial reason for this library was a way for me to learn React and how to create reusable components. As I work on this project, I think that the project could become something usable for the community. First, I need to finish the inital effort of mapping the Boostrap Library and building some simple sites with the components to work out any kinks. But for now, I will continue to work on this until I reach a stopping point or reach my goal of mapping the Bootstrap Library with React Components.

This effort is just a solo project and I may not invite other unless something happens to change that. For now, if you clone this repository, you can get started with it like so: 

``` javascript 
npm install
npm start
```

I may add some pages for each component but for now, the comments for each component in the `code src` folder should be enough.
